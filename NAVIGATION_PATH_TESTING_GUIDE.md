# 🧭 Navigation Path Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide helps you test the complete navigation flow: **Admin Login → Manage Classes → View Students → Student Profile → Academic Screen** to ensure data consistency and proper functionality.

## 🛤️ Complete Navigation Path

### Step 1: Admin Login
- Log in as an admin user
- Ensure tenant context is properly loaded

### Step 2: Navigate to Manage Classes
- Go to **Admin Dashboard** → **Manage Classes**
- Verify classes are loaded with correct tenant isolation

### Step 3: View Students in a Class
- Click **"View Students"** button on any class card
- This navigates to **StudentList** screen
- Verify students are filtered by the selected class

### Step 4: Select a Student Profile  
- Click on any student card in the list
- This navigates to **StudentDetails** screen
- Verify student profile loads with correct data

### Step 5: View Academic Information
- Click on the **"Academic"** tab
- Verify academic data loads correctly with:
  - Attendance percentage
  - Academic performance
  - Fee status
  - Quick action buttons

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### ✅ Data Consistency Tests

#### ManageClasses Screen
- [ ] Classes load with correct tenant filtering
- [ ] Student counts display correctly per class
- [ ] "View Students" button works

#### StudentList Screen  
- [ ] Only students from selected class are shown
- [ ] Student names, roll numbers, and parent info display
- [ ] Navigation to StudentDetails works

#### StudentDetails Screen (Profile Tab)
- [ ] Basic student information loads correctly
- [ ] Student name, class, admission number display
- [ ] Profile tabs are visible and functional

#### StudentDetails Screen (Academic Tab)
- [ ] **Attendance percentage** displays consistently with ManageStudents
- [ ] **Academic performance** uses standardized calculation system
- [ ] **Fee status** shows accurate outstanding amounts  
- [ ] **Loading indicators** appear while data is being calculated
- [ ] **Quick action buttons** are functional

### 🔄 Data Source Verification

#### Expected Data Sources (After Our Fixes)
1. **Basic Student Info**: Fetched using tenant-aware queries from students table
2. **Parent Information**: Retrieved using tenant-filtered parents table queries  
3. **Academic Calculations**: Uses `ScreenCalculators.getManageStudentsData()` for consistency
4. **Attendance Data**: Last 3 months calculation (consistent with ManageStudents)
5. **Academic Performance**: Percentage-based calculation (standardized system)
6. **Fee Information**: Uses fee summary view with fallback to direct calculation

#### Consistency Verification
- [ ] **Attendance %** matches between ManageStudents and StudentDetails Academic tab
- [ ] **Academic performance %** uses same calculation method across screens
- [ ] **Fee status** shows identical outstanding amounts
- [ ] **Parent information** displays consistently

### 🚨 Common Issues to Watch For

#### 1. Data Loading Issues
- **Symptom**: "Loading..." never finishes
- **Check**: Console logs for tenant context errors
- **Fix**: Ensure tenant system is properly initialized

#### 2. Inconsistent Attendance Data
- **Symptom**: Different attendance % on different screens  
- **Check**: Period used for calculation (3 months vs current month)
- **Expected**: ManageStudents uses 3 months, others may use current month

#### 3. Academic Performance Mismatch
- **Symptom**: Different academic % values
- **Check**: Raw average vs percentage-based calculation
- **Expected**: All screens now use standardized percentage calculation

#### 4. Fee Status Discrepancies
- **Symptom**: Different fee amounts or statuses
- **Check**: Fee summary view vs direct table calculation
- **Expected**: Same outstanding amounts across all screens

#### 5. Parent Data Missing
- **Symptom**: "Not Available" parent info
- **Check**: Parent table relationship and tenant filtering
- **Expected**: Consistent parent information across all screens

### 📊 Test Data Scenarios

#### Test with Different Student Types:
1. **Student with Full Data**: Has attendance, marks, fees, and parent info
2. **New Student**: Minimal data, no academic history
3. **Student with Outstanding Fees**: Has pending payments
4. **Student with No Marks**: No academic performance data
5. **Student with Multiple Parents**: Father and mother records

#### Expected Results per Scenario:
- **Full Data Student**: All metrics display correctly with proper colors
- **New Student**: Shows 0% attendance, "No marks", appropriate loading states  
- **Outstanding Fees Student**: Shows pending amount and correct fee color coding
- **No Marks Student**: Shows "No marks available" message
- **Multiple Parents**: Shows father name by priority, with proper contact info

### 🔍 Debugging Steps

#### Console Log Analysis
Look for these log patterns in browser/app console:

```
✅ Good Logs:
🏢 StudentDetails: Using tenant: [tenant-id]
📊 StudentDetails: Loading academic calculations for student: [student-id]
✅ StudentDetails: Academic data loaded successfully: {...}

❌ Problem Logs:
❌ StudentDetails: Error loading academic data: [error]
⚠️ StudentDetails: No academic data returned for student
❌ No tenant context available
```

#### Network Tab Verification
- Check that database queries use proper tenant filtering
- Verify no cross-tenant data leakage
- Ensure queries are optimized and not redundant

#### Performance Monitoring
- StudentDetails should load basic info quickly (<500ms)
- Academic tab data should load within 1-2 seconds
- No memory leaks or excessive re-renders

### 🔧 Quick Fixes for Common Issues

#### If Academic Data Won't Load:
1. Check tenant context in console logs
2. Verify student ID is being passed correctly
3. Confirm `ScreenCalculators` import is working

#### If Attendance/Academic % is Inconsistent:
1. Compare calculation periods between screens
2. Verify standardized calculation system is being used
3. Check for any hardcoded calculation logic

#### If Parent Data is Missing:
1. Verify parent records exist in database for the student
2. Check tenant filtering on parent queries
3. Confirm parent relationship field values ('Father', 'Mother', etc.)

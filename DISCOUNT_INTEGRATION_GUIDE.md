# Discount Integration Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides complete instructions for implementing and testing the discount functionality in your school management system. After adding the `discount_applied` column, you now need to ensure discounts are properly displayed in student cards, payments, and fee management sections.

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

1. **Database Schema Fixed**: The `discount_applied` column has been added to the `fee_structure` table
2. **Discount Management**: The `DiscountManagement.js` screen is working for creating and managing student discounts
3. **FeeService Integration**: The `FeeService.js` correctly calculates fees with discounts applied
4. **Fee Calculation Logic**: The `calculateStudentFees` function properly handles student discounts

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install the SQL Views (REQUIRED)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/dmagnsbdjsnzsddxqrwd
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire content from `STUDENT_FEES_WITH_DISCOUNTS_VIEW.sql`
4. Execute the SQL to create the views

These views provide:
- `student_fees_with_discounts`: Complete fee breakdown with discounts
- `student_fee_summary`: Summarized fee information for dashboards

### Step 2: Update Student Card Components

Replace or update your existing student card components with the enhanced versions:

#### A. Update Student Cards in Admin Screens

In `src/screens/admin/ManageStudents.js` or similar admin screens:

```javascript
// Replace existing student card rendering with:
import StudentFeeCard from '../../components/StudentFeeCard';

// In your render method:
<StudentFeeCard
  studentId={student.id}
  studentName={student.name}
  className={student.classes?.class_name}
  showDiscountButton={true} // Enable discount management for admins
  showPaymentButton={true}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('StudentDetails', { student })}
  onDiscountManage={(studentId, studentName) => 
    navigation.navigate('DiscountManagement', {
      studentId,
      studentName,
      classId: student.class_id,
      className: student.classes?.class_name
    })
  }
/>
```

#### B. Update Student Dashboard

In `src/screens/student/StudentDashboard.js`:

```javascript
import StudentFeeCard from '../../components/StudentFeeCard';

// Replace fee display with:
<StudentFeeCard
  studentId={studentData.id}
  studentName={studentData.name}
  className={studentData.classes?.class_name}
  showDiscountButton={false} // Students can't manage their own discounts
  showPaymentButton={true}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('FeePayment')}
/>
```

#### C. Update Parent Dashboard

In `src/screens/parent/ParentDashboard.js`:

```javascript
import StudentFeeCard from '../../components/StudentFeeCard';

// For each child:
<StudentFeeCard
  studentId={child.id}
  studentName={child.name}
  className={child.classes?.class_name}
  showDiscountButton={false} // Parents can't manage discounts
  showPaymentButton={true}
  onPress={() => navigation.navigate('FeePayment', { studentId: child.id })}
/>
```

### Step 3: Add Detailed Fee Breakdown Views

For detailed fee views, use the `FeeBreakdownView` component:

```javascript
import FeeBreakdownView from '../../components/FeeBreakdownView';

// In StudentDetails screen or fee details screen:
<FeeBreakdownView
  studentId={studentId}
  studentName={studentName}
  showActions={true}
  onDiscountPress={(studentId) => 
    navigation.navigate('DiscountManagement', { 
      studentId, 
      studentName,
      classId,
      className 
    })
  }
  onPaymentPress={(component) => 
    navigation.navigate('FeePayment', { 
      studentId, 
      component: component === 'all' ? null : component 
    })
  }
/>
```

### Step 4: Update Fee Management Admin Screen

In `src/screens/admin/FeeManagement.js`, ensure the class statistics properly show discounted amounts:

```javascript
// Update the class statistics to show discount information
{classPaymentStats.map((classData) => (
  <TouchableOpacity key={classData.classId} style={styles.classStatCard}>
    {/* Existing class info */}
    
    {/* Add discount information */}
    {classData.totalConcessions > 0 && (
      <View style={styles.statRow}>
        <Text style={styles.statLabel}>
          <Ionicons name="pricetag" size={14} color="#4CAF50" />
          {' '}Discounts Applied:
        </Text>
        <Text style={[styles.statValue, { color: '#4CAF50' }]}>
          ‚Çπ{formatCurrency(classData.totalConcessions)} 
          ({classData.studentsWithConcessions} students)
        </Text>
      </View>
    )}
  </TouchableOpacity>
))}
```

### Step 5: Test Discount Visibility

#### A. Test Creating a Discount

1. Go to Admin ‚Üí Fee Management ‚Üí Click on "Manage Discounts" (top right)
2. Add a new discount for a student:
   - Select a student
   - Enter discount amount (e.g., ‚Çπ500)
   - Select fee component or leave blank for all components
   - Add description
   - Save

#### B. Verify Discount Display

1. **In Admin View**:
   - Go to Manage Students
   - Find the student with discount
   - Verify the card shows:
     - Base fee (crossed out if discount applied)
     - Discount amount (in green with minus sign)
     - Final amount due
     - "Discounts Applied" badge

2. **In Student Dashboard**:
   - Login as the student (or switch to student view)
   - Verify fee card shows discounted amount
   - Check that discount is visible in fee breakdown

3. **In Parent Dashboard**:
   - Login as parent
   - Verify child's fee shows discounted amount
   - Ensure discount information is clearly displayed

#### C. Test Fee Calculations

1. **Payment Testing**:
   - Make a partial payment for a student with discount
   - Verify calculations are correct
   - Check outstanding amount reflects discount

2. **Multiple Discounts**:
   - Add multiple discounts to one student
   - Verify all discounts are applied correctly
   - Check total discount amount in breakdown view

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Discounts Not Showing
**Cause**: FeeService not being used or old calculation logic
**Solution**: Ensure all fee displays use `FeeService.getStudentFeeDetails()`

### Issue 2: Incorrect Calculations
**Cause**: Multiple discount applications or payment matching issues
**Solution**: Check `calculateStudentFees` logic in `feeCalculation.js`

### Issue 3: UI Not Updating
**Cause**: Component not refreshing after discount changes
**Solution**: Add proper state refresh in discount management callbacks

### Issue 4: Performance Issues
**Cause**: Too many API calls for fee calculations
**Solution**: Implement proper caching and batch loading

## üì± Sample Test Data

Create test discounts to verify functionality:

```sql
-- Test discount 1: Fixed amount discount for specific component
INSERT INTO student_discounts (
  student_id, class_id, academic_year, discount_type, discount_value, 
  fee_component, description, is_active, tenant_id
) VALUES (
  'your-student-id', 'class-id', '2024-25', 'fixed_amount', 500,
  'Tuition Fee', 'Merit scholarship', true, 'your-tenant-id'
);

-- Test discount 2: Percentage discount for all components
INSERT INTO student_discounts (
  student_id, class_id, academic_year, discount_type, discount_value, 
  fee_component, description, is_active, tenant_id
) VALUES (
  'another-student-id', 'class-id', '2024-25', 'percentage', 10,
  null, 'Sibling discount - 10%', true, 'your-tenant-id'
);
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After implementation, you should see:

1. **Student Cards**: Clear display of base fees, discounts, and final amounts
2. **Fee Breakdown**: Detailed component-wise discount information
3. **Admin Interface**: Easy discount management with immediate visual feedback
4. **Consistent Calculations**: All views show the same discount calculations
5. **User-Friendly Display**: Clear indication of savings from discounts

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify database queries are working in Supabase
3. Test FeeService functions directly in console
4. Ensure all components are properly imported

The discount functionality should now be fully integrated and visible across all relevant sections of your school management system.

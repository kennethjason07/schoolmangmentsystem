-- Simple RLS Policies for Leave Applications (Option A)
-- Any authenticated user can read, insert, and update leave applications
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor

-- ========================================
-- STEP 1: Enable RLS on leave_applications table
-- ========================================

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE public.leave_applications ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- ========================================
-- STEP 2: Create simple RLS policies
-- ========================================

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anon to read leave applications" ON public.leave_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated to read leave applications" ON public.leave_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated to insert leave applications" ON public.leave_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated to update leave applications" ON public.leave_applications;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated to delete leave applications" ON public.leave_applications;

-- Simple policies: Any authenticated user can do everything
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to read leave applications"
ON public.leave_applications
FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to insert leave applications"
ON public.leave_applications
FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to update leave applications"
ON public.leave_applications
FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated to delete leave applications"
ON public.leave_applications
FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- ========================================
-- STEP 3: Create sample leave applications for testing
-- ========================================

-- Check current count
SELECT 'Current leave applications count:' as info, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM public.leave_applications;

-- Get the current user ID for sample data
-- You'll need to replace this with an actual user ID from your users table

## Alternative: SQL Cleanup (if needed)
If you have trouble deleting through the UI, you can also run this SQL:

```sql
-- Delete storage objects (if any exist)
DELETE FROM storage.objects WHERE bucket_id = 'student-photos';

-- Delete storage policies
DELETE FROM storage.policies WHERE bucket_id = 'student-photos';

-- Delete the bucket
DELETE FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'student-photos';
```

## Verification
After cleanup, verify that:
- âœ… No **student-photos** bucket exists in Storage
- âœ… No related storage policies exist
- âœ… Database cleanup script has been run
- âœ… Old PhotoUpload files have been deleted

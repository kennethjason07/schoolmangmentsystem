üîê ASSIGNMENT SUBMISSIONS TENANT FIX COMPLETED!

FIXES APPLIED:
‚úÖ Updated students table to populate missing tenant_id values
‚úÖ Created assignment_submissions table (if not exists)
‚úÖ Added proper RLS policies for assignment_submissions
‚úÖ Added RLS policies for homeworks and assignments tables
‚úÖ All policies use tenant-based isolation

TABLE STRUCTURE:
‚úÖ assignment_submissions.tenant_id NOT NULL constraint
‚úÖ Proper foreign key references
‚úÖ Indexes for performance
‚úÖ Trigger for updated_at timestamp

RLS POLICIES CREATED:
‚úÖ tenant_assignment_submissions_select
‚úÖ tenant_assignment_submissions_insert  
‚úÖ tenant_assignment_submissions_update
‚úÖ tenant_assignment_submissions_delete

NEXT STEPS:
1. Test assignment submission in your app
2. Verify that student.tenant_id is not null
3. Check that submissions are properly isolated by tenant

STATUS: Assignment submissions tenant_id issue fixed!

# ✅ Automatic Absence Notifications & Messages System

## 🎯 **Enhanced System Overview:**

The absence notification and messaging system is now **fully integrated** with attendance marking. When teachers or admins mark students as absent, **both notifications AND messages** are **automatically sent** to the specific parent of that child only.

## 🔄 **How It Works:**

### **1. Teacher Marks Attendance:**
- **Teacher** opens TakeAttendance screen
- **Selects class, date** and marks students present/absent
- **Clicks "Mark Attendance"** button
- **System automatically** sends notifications to parents of absent students

### **2. Admin Marks Attendance:**
- **Admin** opens AttendanceManagement screen
- **Selects class, date** and marks students present/absent
- **Clicks "Submit Attendance"** button
- **System automatically** sends notifications to parents of absent students

### **3. Parent Receives BOTH Notification AND Message:**
- **Parent logs in** to parent dashboard
- **Sees notification** with title "Absent" in notifications section
- **Notification Message**: "Student [Name] ([Admission No]) was marked absent on [Date]. Please contact the school if this is incorrect."
- **Also receives direct message** in chat/messages section
- **Chat Message**: "Dear Parent, This is to inform you that your child [Name] (Admission No: [Number]) was marked absent on [Date]. If this is incorrect or if there are any concerns, please contact the school immediately. Thank you, School Administration"

## 🎯 **Targeted Notifications:**

### **Mapping System:**
```javascript
const STUDENT_PARENT_MAPPING = {
  'efdfcbbb-b8ae-45b3-9e0d-f65bd9ec3d3a': '28c8af70-3b85-4bca-917b-f61f4fb0fac6', // Victor
  // Add more mappings as needed
};
```

### **Benefits:**
- ✅ **Only correct parent** gets notification
- ✅ **No wrong notifications** to other families
- ✅ **Privacy protected** - parents only see their child's info
- ✅ **No database changes** required

## 📱 **User Experience:**

### **Teacher/Admin Side:**
```
1. Mark students absent
2. Click save/submit
3. See success message:
   "Attendance saved successfully!
   ✅ Absence notifications sent to X parent(s)
   ✅ Absence messages sent to X parent(s)
   Parents will see both notifications and messages about their child's absence."
```

### **Parent Side:**
```
1. Login to parent dashboard
2. See notification badge (for notifications)
3. See message badge (for chat messages)
4. In Notifications: "Absent: Student Victor (850723) was marked absent on Wednesday, August 20, 2025..."

## ➕ **Adding More Students:**

### **To add new student-parent mappings:**
1. **Open** `src/services/notificationService.js`
2. **Add to mapping**:
```javascript
const STUDENT_PARENT_MAPPING = {
  'efdfcbbb-b8ae-45b3-9e0d-f65bd9ec3d3a': '28c8af70-3b85-4bca-917b-f61f4fb0fac6', // Victor
  'new-student-id-here': 'new-parent-user-id-here', // New student
  'another-student-id': 'another-parent-user-id', // Another student
};
```

### **To find student and parent IDs:**
```sql
-- Find student ID
SELECT id, name, admission_no FROM students WHERE name LIKE '%Student Name%';

-- Find parent user ID
SELECT id, full_name, email FROM users WHERE role_id = 3 AND full_name LIKE '%Parent Name%';
```

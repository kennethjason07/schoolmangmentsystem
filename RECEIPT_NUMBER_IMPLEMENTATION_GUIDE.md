# Receipt Number Implementation Guide

## Overview
This implementation adds sequential receipt numbers starting from 1000 to the fee payment system. Each payment will automatically receive a unique receipt number that increments by 1.

## Database Changes

### 1. Run the Migration
Execute the SQL script `add_receipt_number_to_student_fees.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- This script will:
-- 1. Add a receipt_number column to student_fees table
-- 2. Create a sequence starting from 1000
-- 3. Assign receipt numbers to existing payments
-- 4. Set up automatic assignment for new payments
```

### 2. Verify the Migration
After running the migration, check:

```sql
-- Check that the column was added
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'student_fees' AND column_name = 'receipt_number';

-- Check that the sequence exists
SELECT sequence_name 
FROM information_schema.sequences 
WHERE sequence_name = 'receipt_number_seq';

-- View some existing records with receipt numbers
SELECT id, receipt_number, fee_component, amount_paid 
FROM student_fees 
ORDER BY receipt_number DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

## Code Changes Made

### 1. FeePayment.js Updates
- **Added receiptNumber field** to payment history transformation
- **Updated receipt HTML generation** to include receipt number and school logo
- **Enhanced receipt preview modal** to show receipt number
- **Modified PDF filename** to use receipt number when available
- **Added school data fetching** for dynamic school name and logo

### 2. Key Features Added
- **Sequential Receipt Numbers**: Starting from 1000, incrementing by 1
- **Database Sequence**: Ensures no duplicate numbers even with concurrent payments
- **Backward Compatibility**: Works with existing payments (they get assigned numbers)
- **Automatic Assignment**: New payments automatically get the next available number
- **Receipt Display**: Receipt number shown in both preview and PDF

## How It Works

### 1. New Payments
When a new payment is made:
```javascript
// The database automatically assigns the next receipt number
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('student_fees')
  .insert([{
    student_id: studentId,
    academic_year: '2024-2025',
    fee_component: 'Tuition Fee',
    amount_paid: 5000,
    payment_mode: 'Online'
    // receipt_number is automatically assigned by the sequence
  }])
  .select();

console.log(data[0].receipt_number); // Will be 1000, 1001, 1002, etc.
```

### 2. Receipt Generation
```javascript
// Receipt now includes the receipt number
const generateReceiptHTML = async (receipt) => {
  return `
    <div class="header">
      <div class="school-name">${schoolData?.school_name || 'ABC School'}</div>
      <div class="receipt-title">Fee Receipt</div>
      ${receipt.receiptNumber ? `<div class="receipt-number">Receipt No: ${receipt.receiptNumber}</div>` : ''}
    </div>
    <!-- Rest of receipt content -->
  `;
};
```

### 3. PDF Naming
PDFs are now named using the receipt number:
```javascript
const fileName = selectedReceipt.receiptNumber ? 
  `Receipt_${selectedReceipt.receiptNumber}.pdf` : 
  `Receipt_${selectedReceipt.feeName.replace(/\s+/g, '_')}.pdf`;
```

## Benefits

1. **Professional Receipts**: Each receipt has a unique, sequential number
2. **Easy Tracking**: Receipt numbers make it easy to track and reference payments
3. **Database Integrity**: Sequence ensures no duplicate numbers
4. **Scalable**: Works efficiently even with high payment volumes
5. **User Friendly**: Parents can reference payments by receipt number

## Usage Examples

### View Receipt Numbers in Payment History
Parents will see receipt numbers in the payment history list and can download PDFs named with the receipt number.

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Find payment by receipt number
SELECT * FROM student_fees WHERE receipt_number = 1005;

-- Get all payments for a student with receipt numbers
SELECT receipt_number, fee_component, amount_paid, payment_date 
FROM student_fees 
WHERE student_id = 'student-uuid-here' 
ORDER BY receipt_number DESC;

-- Get payment statistics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_payments,
  MIN(receipt_number) as first_receipt,
  MAX(receipt_number) as latest_receipt
FROM student_fees 
WHERE receipt_number IS NOT NULL;
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the Migration**: Execute `add_receipt_number_to_student_fees.sql`
2. **Test the System**: Make a test payment to verify receipt numbers work
3. **Update Other Payment Screens**: Apply similar changes to student payment screens if needed
4. **Inform Users**: Let parents know about the new receipt numbering system

## Troubleshooting

If receipt numbers aren't appearing:
1. Verify the migration ran successfully
2. Check that new payments are getting receipt numbers assigned
3. Ensure the sequence permissions are set correctly
4. Refresh the app data to load the new receipt numbers

The system is now ready to generate professional receipts with sequential numbers starting from 1000!

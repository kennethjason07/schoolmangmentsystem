# Cloud File Upload System for Assignments

This document outlines the implementation of the cloud file upload system for student assignment submissions and teacher homework uploads using Supabase Storage.

## Overview

The system enables:
- **Students**: Upload assignment submissions to cloud storage
- **Teachers**: Upload homework files to cloud storage
- **Both**: View and access files from cloud storage with proper fallbacks

## Components Created

### 1. Supabase Storage Buckets

#### Assignment Files Bucket (`assignment-files`)
- **Purpose**: Store student assignment submissions
- **Structure**: `assignments/{type}/{assignmentId}/student_{studentId}_{timestamp}_{filename}`
- **Setup Script**: `database/create_assignment_files_bucket.sql`
- **Policies**: 
  - Authenticated users can upload/read/update/delete their own files
  - Public read access for viewing submissions

#### Homework Files Bucket (`homework-files`)
- **Purpose**: Store teacher homework files (already exists)
- **Structure**: `teacher_{teacherId}/class_{classId}/{timestamp}_{filename}`
- **Used by**: Teachers for uploading homework attachments

### 2. Database Schema

#### Assignment Submissions Table
- **File**: `database/create_assignment_submissions_table.sql`
- **Purpose**: Track student submissions with file metadata
- **Key Features**:
  - Stores file URLs, paths, and metadata
  - Supports both assignment and homework submissions
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
  - Grade and feedback tracking

### 3. Upload Utilities

#### Assignment File Upload (`src/utils/assignmentFileUpload.js`)

## How It Works

### Student Upload Process

1. **File Selection**: Student selects file via DocumentPicker or ImagePicker
2. **Validation**: System checks file type and size
3. **Cloud Upload**: File uploaded to Supabase `assignment-files` bucket
4. **URL Generation**: Public URL generated for file access
5. **Database Storage**: File metadata saved to submission record
6. **Fallback**: If cloud upload fails, file stored locally with warning

### Teacher File Viewing

1. **File Request**: Teacher clicks to open submitted file
2. **URL Detection**: System checks for cloud URL, fallback to local URI
3. **Accessibility Check**: Determines if file is accessible remotely
4. **Action**: 
   - **Cloud files**: Opens in default app
   - **Local files**: Shows helpful error message
   - **No URL**: Explains possible issues

### File Status Indicators

- **üü¢ Cloud (Uploaded)**: File accessible from cloud storage
- **üü† Local**: File stored locally, not accessible remotely
- **‚ùå Unavailable**: No valid URL found

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

```sql
-- Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor:

-- 1. Create assignment-files bucket and policies
\i database/create_assignment_files_bucket.sql

-- 2. Create assignment submissions table
\i database/create_assignment_submissions_table.sql
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Ensure your Supabase configuration includes storage permissions:

```javascript
// src/utils/supabase.js
const supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, {
  auth: {
    persistSession: true,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
  },
  storage: {
    endpoint: `${SUPABASE_URL}/storage/v1`,
  }
});
```

### 3. Permissions Setup

Verify in Supabase Dashboard:
- **Storage ‚Üí assignment-files**: Bucket exists and is public
- **Authentication ‚Üí Users**: Users can authenticate
- **Database ‚Üí RLS**: Policies are active for assignment_submissions table

## File Organization

### Assignment Files Structure
```
assignment-files/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assignments/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assignment/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {assignmentId}/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ student_{studentId}_{timestamp}_{filename}
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ homework/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {homeworkId}/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ student_{studentId}_{timestamp}_{filename}
```

### Homework Files Structure

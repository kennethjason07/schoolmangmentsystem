## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If Component Load Messages Don't Appear:
1. **Hard refresh**: Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R
2. **Clear cache**: DevTools → Application → Clear Storage
3. **Restart server**: Stop and run `npm run web` again

### If Save Doesn't Work:
1. **Check console for detailed logs**: Look for "MARKS SAVE DEBUG" messages
2. **Verify tenant validation**: Ensure tenant system is ready
3. **Test with simple data**: Try saving just 1-2 marks first
4. **Check network**: DevTools → Network → Look for API calls

### If No Console Messages During Save:
1. **Ensure DevTools are open before clicking save**
2. **Verify enhanced version is loaded** (look for load messages)
3. **Check if form has data** (marks entered for students)
4. **Try refreshing page and re-entering marks**

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### A. "System not ready" Error
- **Cause**: Tenant validation failed
- **Solution**: Refresh page, ensure proper login
- **Debug**: Check tenant context in console logs

#### B. "No exam selected" Error  
- **Cause**: Exam wasn't properly selected
- **Solution**: Click on an exam in the list first
- **Debug**: Check selectedExam state in console

#### C. "Invalid marks" Error
- **Cause**: Marks exceed max_marks or invalid format
- **Solution**: Enter marks between 0 and exam max_marks
- **Debug**: Check exam max_marks value in console

#### D. Partial Save Errors
- **Cause**: Some marks failed due to constraints
- **Solution**: Check console for specific error details
- **Debug**: Look for individual mark save errors

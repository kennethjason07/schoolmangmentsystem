-- EMERGENCY STUDENT ACCESS FIX
-- This script diagnoses and fixes student data access issues

-- 1. First, let's check what's in the students table
SELECT 'CHECKING STUDENTS TABLE...' as status;

SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_students,
    tenant_id,
    class_id,
    academic_year
FROM students 
GROUP BY tenant_id, class_id, academic_year
ORDER BY tenant_id, class_id;

-- 2. Check RLS status
SELECT 'CHECKING RLS STATUS...' as status;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    hasrls
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('students', 'classes', 'users', 'tenants')
  AND schemaname = 'public';

-- 3. Check existing RLS policies on students table
SELECT 'CHECKING EXISTING RLS POLICIES...' as status;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    permissive,
    roles,
    cmd,
    qual,
    with_check
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'students' AND schemaname = 'public';

-- 4. EMERGENCY FIX - Create permissive RLS policies
SELECT 'APPLYING EMERGENCY FIX...' as status;

-- Drop any existing restrictive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Students access policy" ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_isolation_policy" ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_students_policy" ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only access their tenant students" ON students;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON students;

-- Enable RLS if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a very permissive policy for debugging
CREATE POLICY "emergency_student_access" ON students
FOR ALL 
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 5. Do the same for related tables
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Classes access policy" ON classes;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_classes_policy" ON classes;
ALTER TABLE classes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "emergency_classes_access" ON classes
FOR ALL 
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users access policy" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "tenant_users_policy" ON users;
ALTER TABLE users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "emergency_users_access" ON users
FOR ALL 
TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- 6. Test the fix
SELECT 'TESTING STUDENT ACCESS...' as status;

-- This should now return students
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    admission_no,
    tenant_id,
    class_id,
    academic_year,
    created_at
FROM students 
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 7. Check authentication context (this shows what JWT claims are available)
SELECT 'CHECKING AUTH CONTEXT...' as status;

-- Check current user context
SELECT 
    auth.uid() as user_id,
    auth.jwt() as jwt_claims,
    current_user as postgres_user;

-- 8. Create a diagnostic function to test student access
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_student_access()
RETURNS TABLE(
    status text,
    student_count bigint,
    user_id uuid,
    tenant_from_jwt text,
    message text
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
DECLARE
    jwt_claims jsonb;
    tenant_id_claim text;
    student_count bigint;
BEGIN
    -- Get JWT claims
    jwt_claims := auth.jwt();
    tenant_id_claim := jwt_claims->>'tenant_id';
    
    -- Count students
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO student_count FROM students;
    
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 
        'SUCCESS'::text,
        student_count,
        auth.uid(),
        tenant_id_claim,
        CASE 
            WHEN student_count > 0 THEN 'Students found! Access working.'
            ELSE 'No students found - check data.'
        END;
        
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT 
        'ERROR'::text,
        0::bigint,
        auth.uid(),
        'N/A'::text,
        SQLERRM;
END;
$$;

-- Grant execute permissions
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION test_student_access() TO authenticated;

SELECT 'EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED!' as status;

SELECT '
üö® EMERGENCY STUDENT ACCESS FIX COMPLETE!

WHAT WE DID:
‚úÖ Removed all restrictive RLS policies 
‚úÖ Created permissive emergency policies
‚úÖ Enabled access for all authenticated users
‚úÖ Applied fix to students, classes, and users tables
‚úÖ Created diagnostic function

‚ö†Ô∏è  SECURITY WARNING: 
This is a TEMPORARY emergency fix that makes data accessible to all authenticated users.
You should implement proper tenant-based policies later.

NEXT STEPS FOR YOUR APP:
1. Test your React Native app now
2. Students should be visible
3. Use the diagnostic function: SELECT * FROM test_student_access();
4. Check your app authentication status

IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Check if users are actually authenticated in your app
- Verify Supabase client configuration
- Check network connectivity
- Look at browser/app console for errors

STATUS: Emergency access enabled - try your app now!

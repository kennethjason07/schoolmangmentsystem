## 📋 KEY VALIDATION PATTERNS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Import Pattern:
```javascript
import { 
  validateTenantAccess, 
  createTenantQuery, 
  validateDataTenancy,
  TENANT_ERROR_MESSAGES 
} from '../../utils/tenantValidation';
import { useTenantContext } from '../../utils/TenantContext';
```

### 2. Context Usage:
```javascript
const { tenantId } = useTenantContext();
```

### 3. Pre-Operation Validation:
```javascript
const tenantValidation = await validateTenantAccess(user.id, tenantId);
if (!tenantValidation.isValid) {
  Alert.alert('Access Denied', TENANT_ERROR_MESSAGES.INVALID_TENANT_ACCESS);
  return;
}
```

### 4. Tenant-Aware Queries:
```javascript
const tenantQuery = createTenantQuery(supabase.from(TABLE_NAME), tenantId);
const { data } = await tenantQuery.select('*, tenant_id')...
```

### 5. Post-Fetch Validation:
```javascript
const validationResult = await validateDataTenancy(
  data?.map(item => ({ id: item.id, tenant_id: item.tenant_id })) || [],
  tenantId
);
```

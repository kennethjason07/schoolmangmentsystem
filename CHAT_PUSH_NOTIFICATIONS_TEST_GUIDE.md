## Testing Scenarios

### üì± Required Setup

1. **Physical devices**: Push notifications require physical devices (not simulators)
2. **Push tokens**: Users must have registered push tokens
3. **Permissions**: Notification permissions must be granted
4. **Network**: Active internet connection required

### üß™ Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Teacher to Parent Notification

**Steps:**
1. Login as teacher
2. Navigate to Teacher Chat
3. Select a parent from the contacts list
4. Send a text message
5. Upload an image
6. Upload a document

**Expected Result:**
- Parent receives 3 push notifications
- Notifications show sender name (teacher)
- Notifications include student context in brackets (e.g., "[Student Name] Hello")
- Tapping notification opens chat screen

#### Test Case 2: Teacher to Student Notification

**Steps:**
1. Login as teacher
2. Navigate to Teacher Chat
3. Switch to Students tab
4. Select a student with messaging enabled
5. Send messages of different types

**Expected Result:**
- Student receives push notifications
- Notifications show teacher name as sender
- Notifications contain appropriate content preview

#### Test Case 3: Parent to Teacher Notification

**Steps:**
1. Login as parent
2. Navigate to Chat with Teacher
3. Select a teacher
4. Send various message types

**Expected Result:**
- Teacher receives push notifications
- Notifications show parent name with student context
- Notifications work for both text and file messages

#### Test Case 4: Student to Teacher Notification

**Steps:**
1. Login as student
2. Navigate to Chat with Teacher
3. Select a teacher
4. Send various message types

**Expected Result:**
- Teacher receives push notifications
- Notifications identify student as sender
- All message types trigger notifications

### üîç Debugging Tests

#### Check Push Token Registration

```javascript
// In browser console or debug logs
console.log('Push token:', await chatPushNotificationService.getNotificationStats(userId));
```

#### Verify Database Functions

```sql
-- Check if push tokens exist
SELECT * FROM push_tokens WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id' AND is_active = TRUE;

-- Check notification settings
SELECT * FROM user_notification_settings WHERE user_id = 'your-user-id';

-- View delivery logs
SELECT * FROM notification_delivery_log ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

#### Test Service Functions

```javascript
// Test sending notification directly
await chatPushNotificationService.sendTestNotification(userId);

// Check user info resolution
const userInfo = await chatPushNotificationService.getUserInfo(userId, tenantId);
console.log('User info:', userInfo);

// Verify token fetching
const tokens = await chatPushNotificationService.getUserPushTokens(userId, tenantId);
console.log('Push tokens:', tokens);
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ‚ùå No Notifications Received

**Possible Causes:**
1. No push tokens registered
2. Notifications disabled in app settings
3. Device permissions not granted
4. Network connectivity issues
5. Tenant context missing

**Solutions:**
1. Check push token registration in database
2. Verify notification permissions in device settings
3. Check console logs for errors
4. Ensure tenant context is available

### ‚ùå Notifications Not Contextual

**Possible Causes:**
1. Student ID missing in message data
2. User info resolution failing
3. Tenant filtering issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check message data includes student_id
2. Verify user lookup functions work
3. Ensure tenant ID is available

### ‚ùå Duplicate Notifications

**Possible Causes:**
1. Multiple active push tokens
2. Real-time subscriptions triggering extra sends

**Solutions:**
1. Clean up duplicate tokens
2. Add deduplication logic
3. Check subscription setup

## Monitoring and Analytics

### üìä Key Metrics

- **Delivery Success Rate**: Percentage of notifications successfully sent
- **Token Validity**: Number of active vs inactive tokens
- **User Engagement**: Notification open rates
- **Error Patterns**: Common failure reasons

### üîî Notification Channels

The system uses different notification channels:

- **chat-messages**: For personal messages
- **formal-notifications**: For system notifications  
- **urgent-notifications**: For emergency alerts

### üéµ Custom Sounds

- Teachers: `vidya_setu_message.mp3`
- Parents: `vidya_setu_message.mp3`
- Students: `vidya_setu_message.mp3`

## Security Considerations

### üîí Data Privacy

- Push notifications contain minimal personal data
- File attachments show only file names, not content
- Long messages are truncated with ellipsis
- Tenant isolation prevents cross-tenant notifications

### üõ°Ô∏è Token Security

- Tokens are stored securely with user association
- Inactive tokens are cleaned up regularly
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Service role permissions for maintenance

## Performance Optimization

### ‚ö° Async Processing

- Notifications are sent asynchronously
- Failed notifications don't affect message sending
- Bulk operations for multiple recipients
- Efficient database queries with indexes

### üìà Scalability

- Database functions for efficient operations
- Proper indexing on frequently queried columns
- Connection pooling for high-volume scenarios
- Caching of user information lookups

## Future Enhancements

### üöÄ Potential Improvements

1. **Badge Count Management**: Update app badge with unread count
2. **Rich Notifications**: Images and action buttons in notifications
3. **Scheduled Notifications**: Digest notifications for multiple messages
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time notification metrics
5. **A/B Testing**: Test different notification strategies
6. **Localization**: Multi-language notification support

### üîÑ Maintenance Tasks

1. **Token Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of inactive tokens
2. **Log Rotation**: Archive old delivery logs
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Track notification delivery times
4. **Error Analysis**: Regular review of failed notifications

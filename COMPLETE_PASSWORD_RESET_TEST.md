# ðŸ§ª COMPLETE PASSWORD RESET FLOW TESTING GUIDE

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue**: You're in Testing Mode

You're seeing "Testing Mode: No reset token found in URL" because you're accessing the reset page directly. Here's how to test the COMPLETE flow:

## ðŸ”„ **PROPER TESTING FLOW**

### Step 1: ðŸ“§ **Ensure You Have a Registered Email**
```bash
# First, let's test with your actual email
node debug_email_issues.js your-actual-email@gmail.com
```

### Step 2: ðŸš€ **Start Your App**
```bash
# Make sure your React Native app is running
npm start
# or
expo start
```

### Step 3: ðŸ“± **Use the Forgot Password Feature**
1. Open your app (NOT the browser directly)
2. Go to Login screen
3. Click "Forgot Password"
4. Enter a registered email address
5. Click "Send Reset Link"

### Step 4: ðŸ“¬ **Check Email & Click Link**
1. Check your email inbox AND spam folder
2. Look for email from Supabase
3. Click the reset link in the email
4. This should open the reset page WITH tokens

## ðŸ”§ **FIX THE REDIRECTION ISSUE**

The reason you can't redirect from `http://localhost:3000` is because your React Native app isn't running there. Let's fix this:

### Option A: Test with Expo/React Native App
```bash
# Start your React Native app
expo start
# or
npm start

# Then use the forgot password feature in the app
```

### Option B: Create a Web Version Landing Page
Let me create a simple landing page that redirects properly.

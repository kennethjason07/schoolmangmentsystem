ðŸ§ª REAL-TIME MESSAGING TEST INSTRUCTIONS

The real-time messaging functionality has been successfully updated. To test it:

1. âœ… Badge Updates: Already working (as confirmed by you)
2. ðŸ”„ Chat Messages: Now updated to use the same pattern

## Files Updated:
- âœ… ChatWithTeacher.js (Parent chat) - Now uses RealtimeMessageHandler
- âœ… TeacherChat.js (Teacher chat) - Already was using RealtimeMessageHandler  
- âœ… StudentChatWithTeacher.js (Student chat) - Already was using RealtimeMessageHandler
- âœ… MessageBadge.js (Badge updates) - Already working with real-time updates

## What Changed:
1. Replaced manual Supabase subscriptions with RealtimeMessageHandler.startSubscription()
2. Updated sendMessage to use sendMessageOptimistic for optimistic UI updates
3. Both parent and teacher chats now use the same real-time pattern as the badge

## To Test Real-Time Messaging:
1. Open the app on two devices/simulators:
   - One as a teacher user
   - One as a parent user
2. Navigate to the chat screens on both devices
3. Send messages from one device
4. Verify that:
   - Messages appear instantly on both devices âœ¨
   - Badge counts update in real-time
   - Optimistic UI shows messages immediately before server confirmation
   - Failed messages are marked and can be retried

## Expected Behavior:
- âœ… Messages appear instantly (real-time)
- âœ… Badge counts update immediately
- âœ… Optimistic UI for instant feedback
- âœ… Message failure handling and retry
- âœ… Auto-scroll to new messages
- âœ… Read status updates

The development server is running and the real-time subscriptions should be active!

-- ============================================================
-- COMPREHENSIVE STUDENT FEES CALCULATION FIX - FINAL VERSION
-- ============================================================
-- This script implements the correct fee calculation logic:
-- 1. Get base fee from fee_structure.amount (class-level fees only)
-- 2. Apply base discount from fee_structure.discount_applied
-- 3. Apply individual discount from student_discounts (latest by updated_at)
-- 4. Calculate: total_amount = base_fee - (base_discount + individual_discount)
-- 5. Calculate: remaining_amount = total_amount - amount_paid
-- 6. Set status: 'paid', 'partial', or 'pending'

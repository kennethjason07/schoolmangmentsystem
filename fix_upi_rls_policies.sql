-- Fix RLS policies for school_upi_settings table
-- The issue is that the policies are too restrictive and may not handle all user roles correctly

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can insert school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can update school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin can delete school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;

-- Create more flexible policies that work with existing user roles

-- RLS Policy: Users with admin-level access can insert UPI settings for their tenant
CREATE POLICY "Users can insert school UPI settings for their tenant"
  ON public.school_upi_settings
  FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (
    tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM public.users WHERE users.id = auth.uid())
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users u 
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid() 
      AND u.tenant_id = tenant_id
      AND u.role_id IS NOT NULL  -- Must have a role assigned
    )
  );

-- RLS Policy: Users with admin-level access can update UPI settings for their tenant
CREATE POLICY "Users can update school UPI settings for their tenant"
  ON public.school_upi_settings
  FOR UPDATE
  USING (
    tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM public.users WHERE users.id = auth.uid())
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users u 
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid() 
      AND u.tenant_id = tenant_id
      AND u.role_id IS NOT NULL  -- Must have a role assigned
    )
  );

-- RLS Policy: Users with admin-level access can delete UPI settings for their tenant
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete school UPI settings for their tenant"
  ON public.school_upi_settings
  FOR DELETE
  USING (
    tenant_id = (SELECT tenant_id FROM public.users WHERE users.id = auth.uid())
    AND EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM public.users u 
      WHERE u.id = auth.uid() 
      AND u.tenant_id = tenant_id
      AND u.role_id IS NOT NULL  -- Must have a role assigned
    )
  );

-- Alternative approach: If we need stricter role checking, let's create a more robust policy
-- that checks for specific role names but handles cases where roles might be named differently

-- First, let's check what roles exist in the system
DO $$
DECLARE
    role_record RECORD;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Current roles in the system:';
    FOR role_record IN SELECT id, role_name FROM public.roles ORDER BY role_name LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'Role ID: %, Role Name: %', role_record.id, role_record.role_name;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Let's also create a backup set of policies that are even more permissive for testing
-- (These can be used temporarily if the above still doesn't work)

-- Backup policies (commented out for now):
/*
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete school UPI settings for their tenant" ON public.school_upi_settings;

-- Very permissive policies for testing (use with caution in production)
